So, you are starting as a Junior Security Operations Specialist.|I.V.A.A.L.|3|
This is quite the job description for a junior position, yes?|I.V.A.A.L.|6|
And I see that you are making... minimum wage?|I.V.A.A.L.|8|
With no benefits...|I.V.A.A.L.|7|
Lucky you! Congratulations!|I.V.A.A.L.|3|
Well then, let us get started!|I.V.A.A.L.|6|
Hello! I am I.V.A.A.L., Bexos’ Interactive Virtual Artificial Assistant Lodestar.|I.V.A.A.L.|3|
I am here to assist your security training for a seamless transition into our grand company.|I.V.A.A.L.|3|
You must have worked so hard to earn a job ranking here.|I.V.A.A.L.|6|
It is quite the position, especially with an employee as…...... unseasoned as yourself….........|I.V.A.A.L.|9|
Anyway, enough about you! Let us get back to work!|I.V.A.A.L.|3|
Your job is a hard one, especially because your usual means of input are all out of order!|I.V.A.A.L.|3|
Only the spacebar, enter, and backspace buttons are functional on your keyboard.|I.V.A.A.L.|6|
That is more than alright though! Do not fret! Humans are so very adaptable after all!|I.V.A.A.L.|3|
Four entire centuries ago someone named Samuel Morse created the telegraph.|I.V.A.A.L.|6|
That technology only had one button and you get a whopping three times more!|I.V.A.A.L.|8|
You can use this ancient and demeaning tool to perform your tasks. Isn’t that such a relief?|I.V.A.A.L.|4|
Right now, you are on the Main Screen.|I.V.A.A.L.|6|
You have access to cameras, one to the Entryway and another to the Trucking Area.|I.V.A.A.L.|6|
Their respcective morse codes are on the reference sheet to the left of your monitor.|I.V.A.A.L.|5|
Perhaps it is confusing, yes?|I.V.A.A.L.|2|
Well, do not worry! It is easy, and we can practice together!!!|I.V.A.A.L.|3|
Let us do that now!|I.V.A.A.L.|3|
Go to the Trucking Area and the Entryway.|I.V.A.A.L.|6|
There should be a note of reference to the left of your monitor!|I.V.A.A.L.|6|
