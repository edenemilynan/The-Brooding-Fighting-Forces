What is it, you wonder? Well… the automatic door in the Entryway is not functional!|I.V.A.A.L.|6|

You see, you are guarding a very important place- High Lord Bexos’ personal office!|5|
That means you can only let authorized personnel enter!|I.V.A.A.L.|7|
How do you know? Well, the entryway has a built-in, handy-dandy scanner!|I.V.A.A.L.|6|
Just type "I" with the entryway window active to activate the scanner!|I.V.A.A.L.|6|
